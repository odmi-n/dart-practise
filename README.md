# Hamburger Menu Sample

A minimal Flutter sample that demonstrates a hamburger-style navigation drawer using basic widgets such as `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, `Drawer`, `ListTile`, `Card`, and `Chip`.

## Getting started

1. Install the Flutter SDK (3.3.0 or later).
2. Fetch dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Run the app on an emulator or device:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## What to try

- Tap the hamburger icon to open the drawer.
- Choose different menu items to update the content shown in the main panel.
- Close the menu with the "Close Menu" button or by swiping.
